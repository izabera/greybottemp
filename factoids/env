The environment comprises the subset of variables that are exported, either permanently by the "export" statement or temporarily by prefix assignment. All variables are copied to subshells, but only exported variables are received by other programs; that is the ONLY effect of "export". It's intentionally not possible to modify variables in another process. http://mywiki.wooledge.org/Environment
