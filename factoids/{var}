Redirections prefaced by {var} allocate a spare filedescriptor and assign its number to the variable. Note that they apply to the whole shell, not just to the command, similar to other redirections on exec. To prevent confusion, we recommend only using the {var}< and {var}> redirections on the "exec", to make it clear that they persist in the shell beyond the command they appear in.
