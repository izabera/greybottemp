C-style for loop: for (( INIT; COND; STEP )); do COMMANDS; done # Evaluate INIT; then, while COND evaluates to true, do COMMANDS, and evaluate STEP. Each expression is evaluated in a math context. Example: for ((i=1; i<=n; i++)); do echo "$i"; done. Use in place of the non-working: for i in {1..$number}
