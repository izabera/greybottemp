Why type "./foo" when "foo" is in $PWD? If you type a command without a "/" in it, the shell will only look for it in the places listed in $PATH (and "." isn't). So you need to provide a filepath with at least one "/", and "./foo" just happens to be the shortest, but you can use any valid relative or absolute filepath, including "$PWD/foo" or "././././foo" or even "some_valid_subdirectory/../foo".
