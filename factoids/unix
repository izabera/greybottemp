You should be fully aware that when people say Unix they do not necessarily mean "The copyrighted proprietary operating system currently owned by AT&T or Novell or SCO or Cisco or whoever the fuck owns the copyright at this particular instant of time", but rather the whole FUCKING SPECTRUM OF UNIX-LIKE OSES including AIX, HP-UX, Linux, BSD, Solaris, etc.
