The difference between $@ and $*: "$@" (quoted) expands to each positional parameter as its own argument: "$1" "$2" ... while "$*" expands to the single argument "$1c$2c..." where c is the first character of IFS. You almost always want "$@". The same goes for arrays: "${array[@]}" or "${array[*]}". Unquoted $* and $@ are undefined; DO NOT use.
