If someone takes you to task for your ignorance, and you reply by asking them to "relax", what you are really saying is, "Yes, I am ignorant, and I intend to remain that way. I shall not read the fine manual, nor shall I exert any efforts whatsoever to improve myself. I shall continue to be a leech upon the IRC channel."
